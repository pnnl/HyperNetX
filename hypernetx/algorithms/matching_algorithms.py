def greedy_d_approximation(hypergraph: list, d: int) -> int:

    Algorithm 1: Greedy d-Approximation for Hypergraph Matching
    Finds a greedy d-approximation for hypergraph matching.

    Parameters:
    hypergraph (list): A list of tuples, each representing a hyperedge in the hypergraph.
    d (int): The size of each hyperedge, assuming the hypergraph is d-uniform.

    Returns:
    int: The size of the d-approximate matching.

    Examples:
    >>> hypergraph = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]
    >>> greedy_d_approximation(hypergraph, 3)
    2

    Algorithm 2: HEDCS-Based Approximation for Hypergraph Matching
    Computes an approximation to the maximum matching in hypergraphs using HyperEdge Degree Constrained Subgraph (HEDCS).

    Parameters:
    hypergraph (list): A list of tuples, each representing a hyperedge in the hypergraph.
    d (int): The uniform size of each hyperedge in the hypergraph.
    epsilon (float): A parameter influencing the trade-off between approximation quality and computational complexity.

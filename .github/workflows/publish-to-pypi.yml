# This workflow uses the Github Action, poetry-publish.
# It will build the HNX package into a wheel and sdist and then publish those artifacts to TestPyPi and PyPi using poetry.
# Documentation for this action is at: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-python-poetry-package
# For building and publishing to PyPi in Github Workflows, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python#publishing-to-package-registries

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

Description: 
            The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for complex network data.
            HyperNetX uses data structures designed to represent set systems containing
            nested data and/or multi-way relationships. The library generalizes traditional
            graph metrics to hypergraphs.
        
            The current version is preliminary. We are actively testing and would be grateful
            for comments and suggestions. Expect changes in both class names and methods as
            many of the requirements demanded of the library are worked out.

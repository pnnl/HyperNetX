Description: 
            The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for the analysis
            and visualization of complex network data modeled as hypergraphs. 
            The library generalizes traditional graph metrics.
        
            HypernetX was developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the
            Hypernets project as part of its High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) program.
            PNNL is operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under Contract DE-ACO5-76RL01830.

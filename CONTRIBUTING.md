# Contributor orientation

If you have ideas for improving this project, we would love to hear from you!

## Orientation

The world of open source is wide; it can be a lot to take in!  If this is your first time working with an open source project, then welcome!    If you're an experienced contributor, then welcome back!  Either way, this online resource might help you [get oriented, or brush up](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) on the process.

## Report an issue, bug, or feature request

Here are the [steps to creating an issue on github](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart).  When reporting a bug,

- search for related issues on Github. You might be able to get answer without the hassle of creating an issue
- describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
  - (if applicable) provide error messages
  - (if applicable) provide a step by step description of the problem; if possible include code that others can use to reproduce it
  - You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
  - provide clear, specific title
  - include details on your setup (operating system, python version, etc.)
- use the most recent version of this library and the source language (e.g. Rust); that fixes a lot of problems
- here are [more details on getting the most out of issue reporting!](https://marker.io/blog/how-to-write-bug-report)

## Contribute new code

Here is a [step-by-step guide to writing new code, and submiting it to the project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

The more you know about a software library, the easier it is to get started writing code.  The best way to learn about this project is its the documentation!  See `README.md` to get started.

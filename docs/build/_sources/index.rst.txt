HyperNetX (HNX)
===============

Description
===========

The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for modeling the entities and relationships found in complex network data. Entities and the relationships between them are dual to each other in HyperNetX. Both can be represented as either nodes or as (hyper)edges. HyperNetX uses data structures designed to represent set systems containing nested data and/or multi-way relationships. The library generalizes traditional graph metrics to hypergraphs. 

The current version is preliminary. We are actively testing and would be grateful for comments and suggestions.  Expect changes in both class names and methods as many of the requirements demanded of the library are worked out. 

For comments and questions you may contact the developers directly at:

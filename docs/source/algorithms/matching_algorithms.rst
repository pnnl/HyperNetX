Matching Algorithms for Hypergraphs
===================================

Introduction
------------
This module implements various algorithms for finding matchings in hypergraphs. These algorithms are based on the methods described in the paper:

*Distributed Algorithms for Matching in Hypergraphs* by Oussama Hanguir and Clifford Stein.

The paper addresses the problem of finding matchings in d-uniform hypergraphs, where each hyperedge contains exactly d vertices. The matching problem is NP-complete for d ≥ 3, making it one of the classic challenges in computational theory. The algorithms described here are designed for the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which is suitable for processing large-scale hypergraphs.

Mathematical Foundation
------------------------
The algorithms in this module provide different trade-offs between approximation ratios, memory usage, and computation rounds:

1. **O(d²)-approximation algorithm**:
   - This algorithm partitions the hypergraph into random subgraphs and computes a matching for each subgraph. The results are combined to obtain a matching for the original hypergraph.
   - Approximation ratio: O(d²)
   - Rounds: 3
   - Memory: O(√nm)

2. **d-approximation algorithm**:
   - Uses sampling and post-processing to iteratively build a maximal matching.
   - Approximation ratio: d
   - Rounds: O(log n)
   - Memory: O(dn)

3. **d(d−1 + 1/d)²-approximation algorithm**:
   - Utilizes the concept of HyperEdge Degree Constrained Subgraphs (HEDCS) to find an approximate matching.
   - Approximation ratio: d(d−1 + 1/d)²
   - Rounds: 3
   - Memory: O(√nm) for linear hypergraphs, O(n√nm) for general cases.

These algorithms are crucial for applications that require scalable parallel processing, such as combinatorial auctions, scheduling, and multi-agent systems.

Usage Example
-------------
Below is an example of how to use the matching algorithms module.

```python
from hypernetx.algorithms import matching_algorithms as ma

# Example hypergraph data
hypergraph = ... # Assume this is a d-uniform hypergraph

# Compute a matching using the O(d²)-approximation algorithm
matching = ma.matching_approximation_d_squared(hypergraph)

# Compute a matching using the d-approximation algorithm
matching_d = ma.matching_approximation_d(hypergraph)

# Compute a matching using the d(d−1 + 1/d)²-approximation algorithm
matching_d_squared = ma.matching_approximation_dd(hypergraph)

print(matching, matching_d, matching_d_squared)

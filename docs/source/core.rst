HyperNetX
==================

HyperNetX is a Python package designed for the creation, manipulation, and analysis of hypergraphs. This documentation provides a detailed reference for the core components of the library. These components are:

*   **Hypergraphs:** This section documents the core data structures and classes used to represent hypergraphs within HyperNetX. It includes detailed API documentation for classes such as `Hypergraph`, `PropertyStore`, `IncidenceStore`, and `HypergraphView`, along with their associated methods and attributes.

*   **Algorithms:** This section documents the algorithms implemented in HyperNetX for analyzing hypergraphs. It provides API documentation for functions related to connectivity, distance, centrality, community detection, and other hypergraph metrics.

*   **Drawing:** This section documents the tools provided by HyperNetX for visualizing hypergraphs. It includes API documentation for functions and classes related to layout algorithms, rendering options, and other visualization utilities.

*   **Reports:** This section documents the functionality for generating reports and summaries of hypergraph data. It provides API documentation for functions that calculate statistical information and other relevant metrics.

`HNX`_ is a Python library for hypergraphs, the natural models for multi-dimensional network data.  

To get started, try the  :ref:`interactive COLAB tutorials<colab>`.  For a primer on hypergraphs, try this :ref:`gentle introduction<hypergraph101>`.  To see hypergraphs at work in cutting-edge research, see our list of recent :ref:`publications<publications>`.

Why hypergraphs?
----------------

Like graphs, hypergraphs capture important information about networks and relationships.  But hypergraphs do more -- they model *multi-way* relationships, where ordinary graphs only capture two-way relationships. This library serves as a repository of methods and algorithms that have proven useful over years of exploration into what hypergraphs can tell us. 

As both vertex adjacency and edge
incidence are generalized to be quantities,
hypergraph paths and walks have both length and *width* because of these multiway connections. 
Most graph metrics have natural generalizations to hypergraphs, but since
hypergraphs are basically set systems, they also admit to the powerful tools of algebraic topology,
including simplicial complexes and simplicial homology, to study their structure.

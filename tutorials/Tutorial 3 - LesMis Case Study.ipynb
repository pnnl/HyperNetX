As mother of Cosette, she sacrifices her life in the support of her daughter and lays the charge on Jean Valjean to care for Cosette when she dies.  In contrast to Fantine, Jean Valjean and Cosette appear in all of the volumes. A central story to the novel follows their travels as they flee from the unrelentless pursuit of Javert and the dogged and often comical abuses of Thenardier. Jean Valjean, originally convicted for stealing bread, begins as a hardened convict but through the mercy of a bishop is transformed into a philanthropist. \n",

Much character development is done, including a long description of Waterloo ending with the singular way in which Thenardier obtained a silver cross of the Legion of Honour while saving the life of one Pontmercy.\n",

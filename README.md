The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for the analysis
and visualization of complex network data modeled as hypergraphs.
The library generalizes traditional graph metrics.

HypernetX was developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the
Hypernets project as part of its High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) program.
PNNL is operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under Contract DE-ACO5-76RL01830.

New Features in Version 2.0
===========================

HNX 2.0 now accepts metadata as core attributes of the edges and nodes of a
hypergraph. While the library continues to accept lists, dictionaries and
dataframes as basic inputs for hypergraph constructions, both cell
properties and edge and node properties can now be easily added for
retrieval as object attributes.

The core library has been rebuilt to take advantage of the flexibility and speed of Pandas Dataframes.
Dataframes offer the ability to store and easily access hypergraph metadata. Metadata can be used for filtering objects, and characterize their
distributions by their attributes.

**Version 2.0 is not backwards compatible. Objects constructed using version
1.x can be imported from their incidence dictionaries.**

What's New
----------
1. The Hypergraph constructor now accepts nested dictionaries with incidence cell properties, pandas.DataFrames, and 2-column Numpy arrays.
1. Additional constructors accept incidence matrices and incidence dataframes.
1. Hypergraph constructors accept cell, edge, and node metadata.
1. Metadata available as attributes on the cells, edges, and nodes.
1. User-defined cell weights and default weights available to incidence matrix.
1. Meta data persists with restrictions and removals.
1. Meta data persists onto s-linegraphs as node attributes of Networkx graphs.
1. New hnxwidget available using  `pip install hnxwidget`.


What's Changed
--------------
1. The `static` and `dynamic` distinctions no longer exist. All hypergraphs use the same underlying data structure, supported by Pandas dataFrames. All hypergraphs maintain a `state_dict` to avoid repeating computations.
1. Methods for adding nodes and hyperedges are currently not supported.
1. The `nwhy` optimizations are no longer supported.
1. Entity and EntitySet classes are being moved to the background. The Hypergraph constructor does not accept either.

Installation
====================

The recommended installation method for most users is to create a virtual environment and install HyperNetX from PyPi.

HyperNetX may be cloned or forked from [Github](https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX).

Prerequisites
-------------
HyperNetX officially supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.

Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

### Using venv


```shell
python -m venv venv-hnx
source venv-hnx/bin/activate
```


### Using Anaconda


```shell
conda create -n venv-hnx python=3.11 -y
conda activate venv-hnx
```


### Using virtualenv


```shell
virtualenv venv-hnx
source venv-hnx/bin/activate
```


### For Windows Users

On both Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt, you can use the following command to activate your virtual environment:

```shell
.\env-hnx\Scripts\activate
```

To deactivate your environment, use:

```shell
.\env-hnx\Scripts\deactivate
```

Installing HyperNetX
====================

Regardless of how you install HyperNetX, ensure that your environment is activated and that you are running Python >=3.8.


Installing from PyPi
--------------------

```shell
pip install hypernetx
```

Installing from Source
----------------------

Ensure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX.git
cd HyperNetX

# Create a virtual environment
make venv
source venv-hnx/bin/activate

# install required dependencies
make install
```

Development
===========

Install an editable version
```
pip install -e .
```

Install additional dependencies to support testing and jupyter notebooks:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also install all these requirements in one Make target:

```
make install
```

Poetry
======

This library uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage dependencies and packaging. Poetry can also be
used to manage your environment for development.

Prerequisites
-------------

* [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)


Configure Poetry
----------------

[Configure your Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/) to create the virtual environment in your project directory:
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# check the poetry configuration
poetry config --list
```

Set up virtual environment
----------------------------

Create and activate a virtual environment.
```
poetry shell
```

NOTE: If you plan to use Poetry to manage your virtual environment, you can activate the virtual environment
using poerty: `poetry shell`. Another option is to directly

Install required dependencies and HyperNetX in editable mode.
```
poetry install
```

Install support for testing
-----------------------------

> ℹ️ **NOTE:** This project has a pytest configuration file named 'pytest.ini'. By default, pytest will use those configuration settings to run tests.

```shell
poetry install --with test

# run tests
python -m pytest

# run tests and show coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=hypernetx

# Generate an HTML code coverage report and view it on a browser
coverage html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

Install support for tutorials
-----------------------------

```
poetry install --with tutorials

# open Jupyter notebooks in a browser
make tutorials
```

Code Quality
------------
HyperNetX uses a number of tools to maintain code quality:

* Pylint
* Black

Before using these tools, ensure that you install Pylint in your environment:

```
poetry install --with lint
```

Pylint
------

[Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) is a static code analyzer for Python-based projects. From the [Pylint docs](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#what-is-pylint):

> Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored. Pylint can infer actual values from your code using its internal code representation (astroid). If your code is import logging as argparse, Pylint will know that argparse.error(...) is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call.

To run Pylint and view the results of Pylint, run the following command:

```shell
pylint hypernetx
```

You can also run Pylint on the command line to generate a report on the quality of the codebase and save it to a file named "pylint-results.txt":

```shell
pylint hypernetx --output=pylint-results.txt
```

For more information on configuration, see https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration/index.html

Black
-----
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a PEP 8 compliant formatter for Python-based project. This tool is highly opinionated about how Python should be formatted and will automagically reformat your code.


```shell
black hypernetx
```

Documentation
-------------

Build and view documentation locally:

```
poetry install --with docs
cd docs
make html
open docs/build/html/index.html
```

When editing documentation, you can auto-rebuild the documentation locally so that you can view your document changes
live on the browser without having to rebuild every time you have a change.

```
cd docs
make livehtml
```

This make script will run in the foreground on your terminal. You should see the following:

```shell
The HTML pages are in docs/html.
[I 230324 09:50:48 server:335] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 230324 09:50:48 handlers:62] Start watching changes
[I 230324 09:50:48 handlers:64] Start detecting changes
[I 230324 09:50:54 handlers:135] Browser Connected: http://127.0.0.1:8000/install.html
[I 230324 09:51:02 handlers:135] Browser Connected: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Click on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/install.html` to open the docs on your browser. Since this will auto-rebuild, every time
you change a document file, it will automatically render on your browser, allowing you to verify your document changes.


Continuous Integration
======================

This project runs Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions. Normally, CI runs
on pull requests, pushes to certain branches, and other events.

Maintainers of the GitHub repository can manually trigger CI using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). See instructions below on how to manually trigger CI on GitHub Actions:

```commandline
# login to Github
gh auth login --with-token <  ~/.ssh/tokens/<path to my personal access token>

# Trigger CI
gh workflow run ci.yml --repo pnnl/HyperNetX --ref <name of branch that you want CI to run on> --field triggeredBy="<Your name>"

# Get the status of the workflow
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --repo pnnl/HyperNetX
```


Versioning
==========

This project uses [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) to manage versioning.
The files where "version" will be updated are listed in the '.cz.toml' file. To create a new version and the associated tag,
run the following commands:

```shell
# Install commitizen tool to environment
pip install commitizen

# Updates version; values for '--increment' can be MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH
# Autocreates a tag and commit for the updated version
cz bump  --increment MAJOR  --dry-run
cz bump  --increment MAJOR
```

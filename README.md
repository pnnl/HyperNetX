The HNX library provides classes and methods for modeling the entities and relationships
found in complex networks as hypergraphs, the natural models for multi-dimensional network data.
As strict generalizations of graphs, hyperedges can represent arbitrary multi-way relations
among entities, and in particular can distinguish cliques and simplices, and admit singleton edges.
As both vertex adjacency and edge
incidence are generalized to be quantities,
hypergraph paths and walks thereby have both length and *width* because of these multiway connections.
Most graph metrics have natural generalizations to hypergraphs, but since
hypergraphs are basically set systems, they also admit to the powerful tools of algebraic topology,
including simplicial complexes and simplicial homology, to study their structure.

This library serves as a repository of the methods and algorithms we find most useful
as we explore what hypergraphs can tell us. We have a growing community of users and contributors.

The code in this repository is intended to support researchers modeling data
as hypergraphs. We have a growing community of users and contributors.
Documentation is available at: <https://pnnl.github.io/HyperNetX/>
For questions and comments contact the developers directly at: <hypernetx@pnnl.gov>

New Features of Version 1.0
---------------------------

1. Hypergraph construction can be sped up by reading in all of the data at once. In particular the hypergraph constructor may read a Pandas dataframe object and create edges and nodes based on column headers. The new hypergraphs are given an attribute `static=True`.
2. A C++ addon called [NWHy](docs/build/nwhy.html) can be used in Linux environments to support optimized hypergraph methods such as s-centrality measures.
3. A JavaScript addon called [Hypernetx-Widget](docs/build/widget.html) can be used to interactively inspect hypergraphs in a Jupyter Notebook.
4. Four new tutorials highlighting the s-centrality metrics, static Hypergraphs, [NWHy](docs/build/nwhy.html), and [Hypernetx-Widget](docs/build/widget.html).

New Features of Version 1.1
---------------------------

1. Static Hypergraph refactored to improve performance across all methods.
2. Added modules and tutorials for Contagion Modeling, Community Detection, Clustering, and Hypergraph Generation.
3. Cell weights for incidence matrices may be added to static hypergraphs on construction.

Installing HyperNetX
====================
HyperNetX may be cloned or forked from: <https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX>

To install in an Anaconda environment
-------------------------------------

    >>> conda create -n <env name> python=3.7
    >>> source activate <env name>
    >>> pip install hypernetx

Mac Users: If you wish to build the documentation you will need
the conda version of matplotlib:

    >>> conda create -n <env name> python=3.7 matplotlib
    >>> source activate <env name>
    >>> pip install hypernetx

To use [NWHy](docs/build/nwhy.html) use python=3.9 and the conda version of tbb in your environment.
**Note** that [NWHy](docs/build/nwhy.html) only works on Linux and some OSX systems. See [NWHy documentation](docs/build/nwhy.html) for more.:

    >>> conda create -n <env name> python=3.9 tbb
    >>> source activate <env name>
    >>> pip install hypernetx
    >>> pip install nwhy

To install in a virtualenv environment
--------------------------------------

    >>> virtualenv --python=<path to python 3.7 executable> <path to env name>

This will create a virtual environment in the specified location using
the specified python executable. For example:

    >>> virtualenv --python=C:\Anaconda3\python.exe hnx

This will create a virtual environment in .\hnx using the python
that comes with Anaconda3.

    >>> <path to env name>\Scripts\activate<file extension>

If you are running in Windows PowerShell use <file extension>=.ps1

If you are running in Windows Command Prompt use <file extension>=.bat

Otherwise use <file extension>=NULL (no file extension).

Once activated continue to follow the installation instructions below.


Install using Pip options
-------------------------
For a minimal installation:

    >>> pip install hypernetx

For an editable installation with access to jupyter notebooks:

    >>> pip install [-e] .

> ℹ️ **TIP:**  For the following installation commands, if you are using ZSH as your shell, you might encounter the
> following error:
>>**zsh: no matches found: .[tutorials]**
>
> To successfully run the below installation commands, put the single quote around the square brackets. For example:
> >pip install -e .'[tutorials]'
>
> For more information on this ZSH-related issue, see this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68888466/11145086).

To install with the tutorials:

    >>> pip install -e .['tutorials']

To install with the documentation:

    >>> pip install -e .['documentation']
    >>> chmod 755 build_docs.sh
    >>> sh build_docs.sh
    ## This will generate the documentation in /docs/build/
    ## Open them in your browser with /docs/index.html

To install and test using pytest:

    >>> pip install -e .['testing']

    # run tests
    >>> python -m pytest

    # run tests and show coverage report
    >>> python -m pytest --cov=hypernetx

    # Generate an HTML code coverage report and view it on a browser
    >>> coverage html
    >>> open htmlcov/index.html

To install the whole shabang:

    >>> pip install -e .['all']

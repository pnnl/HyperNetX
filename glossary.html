<span id="glossary"></span><h1>Glossary of HNX terms<a class="headerlink" href="#glossary-of-hnx-terms" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The HNX library centers around the idea of a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-hypergraph"><span class="xref std std-term">hypergraph</span></a>.  This glossary provides a few key terms and definitions.</p>
<dl class="simple glossary">
<dt id="term-degree">degree<a class="headerlink" href="#term-degree" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>Given a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence), the degree of a node in Nodes is the number of edges in Edges to which the node is incident.
See also: <span class="xref std std-term">s-degree</span></p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-dual">dual<a class="headerlink" href="#term-dual" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>The dual of a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence) switches the roles of Nodes and Edges. More precisely, it is the hypergraph (Edges, Nodes, Incidence’), where Incidence’ is the function that assigns Incidence(n,e) to each pair (e,n).  The <a class="reference internal" href="#term-incidence-matrix"><span class="xref std std-term">incidence matrix</span></a> of the dual hypergraph is the transpose of the incidence matrix of (Nodes, Edges, Incidence).</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-edge-nodes-aka-edge-elements">edge nodes (aka edge elements)<a class="headerlink" href="#term-edge-nodes-aka-edge-elements" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>The nodes (or elements) of an edge e in a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence) are the nodes that are incident to e.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Entity-and-Entity-set">Entity and Entity set<a class="headerlink" href="#term-Entity-and-Entity-set" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>Class in entity.py.
HNX stores many of its data structures inside objects of type Entity.  Entities help to insure safe behavior, but their use is primarily technical, not mathematical.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-hypergraph">hypergraph<a class="headerlink" href="#term-hypergraph" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>The term <em>hypergraph</em> can have many different meanings.  In HNX, it means a tuple (Nodes, Edges, Incidence), where Nodes and Edges are sets, and Incidence is a function that assigns a value of True or False to every pair (n,e) in the Cartesian product Nodes x Edges.  We call
- Nodes the set of nodes
- Edges the set of edges
- Incidence the incidence function
<em>Note</em> Another term for this type of object is a <em>multihypergraph</em>.  The ability to work with multihypergraphs efficiently is a distinguishing feature of HNX!</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-incidence">incidence<a class="headerlink" href="#term-incidence" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>A node n is incident to an edge e in a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence) if Incidence(n,e) = True.
!!! – give the line of code that would allow you to evaluate</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-incidence-matrix">incidence matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#term-incidence-matrix" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>A rectangular matrix constructed from a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence) where the elements of Nodes index the matrix rows, and the elements of Edges index the matrix columns. Entry (n,e) in the incidence matrix is 1 if n and e are incident, and is 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-simple-hypergraph">simple hypergraph<a class="headerlink" href="#term-simple-hypergraph" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>A hypergraph for which no edge is completely contained in another.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-subhypergraph">subhypergraph<a class="headerlink" href="#term-subhypergraph" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>A subhypergraph of a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence) is a hypergraph (Nodes’, Edges’, Incidence’) such that Nodes’ is a subset of Nodes, Edges’ is a subset of Edges, and every incident pair (n,e) in (Nodes’, Edges’, Incidence’) is also incident in (Nodes, Edges, Incidence)</p>
</dd>

</dd>
<dt id="term-toplex">toplex<a class="headerlink" href="#term-toplex" title="Permalink to this term"></a></dt><dd><p>A toplex in a hypergraph (Nodes, Edges, Incidence ) is an edge e whose node set isn’t properly contained in the node set of any other edge.  That is, if f is another edge and ever node incident to e is also incident to f, then the node sets of e and f are identical.</p>
